Next you will find information about the specific scripts for each building type

- buildlocal <targetDir>
    * Builds the current trunk and installs it on a target location.
    * Needs JAVA_HOME variable to be exported on the environment.
    * If the target dir is protected you need to execute this script with root mode (remember to export the JAVA_HOME on root)

- buildpackages
    * Builds COMPSs RPM and DEB packages

- buildscs
    * Builds the current runtime trunk locally, builds the bindings at the SCs accounts and installs both at a target location (at each SC).

- cross-compile/armhf/buildlocal
    * Builds the current trunk for the target architecture, if set, it builds the native architecture 
      and enables the cross-compilation for the target one, the file that sets the target architecture is environmentrc.
    * To enable cross-compilation with a not supported architecture, you should modify environmentrc and set your toolchain properly.
